## 🚨 **Important Updates**

### 🔒 **Third-Party Integrations**

**We’ve temporarily disabled "Allow integration requests from outside collaborators" due to a rise in suspicious requests.**  


### ⏳ **Interaction Limits**

To reduce spam, accounts less than 24 hours old are currently restricted from participating in `github.com/community` Discussions. New users are encouraged to use the search function or return after 24 hours. We appreciate your understanding!  


> **For details on implementing interaction limits in your own organizations and repositories, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-organization).**
